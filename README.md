AdaptiveTest
AdaptiveTest is an application that implements 8-grade students’ aptitude tested on math, recognizing critical information from a given image, spelling, listening, and writing.

On the Math Test, students are asked 5 questions in multiple choice. Questions in 3 difficulties: TOUGH, TOUGHER and TOUGHEST. Values for those questions are 2, 5, 10 scores respectively

In the category of recognizing critical information from a given big image/picture, the student will be prompted to do mouse-clicks on the similar patterns scattered across the hazier big picture displayed on the screen. In this category, the image and its patterns can be hazy, hazier, and haziest, representing the marks 2, 5, and 10 respectively for successful clicks.

In the category of spelling, the student will be prompted to spell a positive word starting with “G”, “J”, and “Z”, allowing him/her to receive 2, 5, and 10 marks respectively for correct answers.

In the category of listening, the student will be prompted to select the keyword(s) from one-sentence recorded voice, two-sentence recorded voice, and three-sentence recorded voice. For 1-sentence, 2-sentence, and 3-sentence recorded voice of diverse accent, he/she will receive 2, 5, and 10 marks respectively for correct answers
